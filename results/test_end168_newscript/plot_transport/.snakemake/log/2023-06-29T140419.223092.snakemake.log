MissingOutputException in rule plots_together in file /home/au731993/Documents/test_end168/plot_transport/Snakefile, line 28:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/generators.png
Removing output files of failed job plots_together since they might be corrupted:
results/vehiclenb.png
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
